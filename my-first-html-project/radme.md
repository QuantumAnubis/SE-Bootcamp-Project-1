Name: Jack Atkinson

Description: Meant as a photo blog for pictures of various minerals and rocks found by a rockhound.

Contains a homepage, about me, and contact me page.

Uses .html, .css, and boodstrap

Ideas for improvement: Add actual pictures and text to site, add navbar, make carousel look better, and include all requirements from assignment I was unable to add.
